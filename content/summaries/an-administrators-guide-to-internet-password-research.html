# Categorizing Accounts

* *don't care*: no impact
    * one-time email, nuisance accounts for free articles
    * don't bother users about security of these passwords
* *low consequence*: minimal impact or easily repaired
    * social networks (infrequent users), discussion groups (infrequent users), online newspapers, accounts not storing credit cards
    * users may just rely on password reset
* *medium consequence*: limited loss (e.g. $50 cap on credit card loss)
    * secondary email account, online shopping sites, social network accounts (casual users), human resource sites
    * user effort resisting online attacks is well spent

---

# Categorizing Accounts

* *high consequence*: critical accounts related to employment, finance, or important documents
    * primary or professional email accounts, social networks (heavy users and celebrities), online banking, SSH and VPN access, corporate databases
    * spend user effort securing passwords, provide two-factor authentication

* *ultra-sensitive*: major, life-altering, irreversible damage
    * multi-million dollar banking transactions, authorization to launch military weapons, encryption of national secrets
    * use something better than a password

---

# Password Strength

* examined leaked datasets from Rockyou, Gawker, Tianya, eHarmony, LinkedIn, Evernote, Adobe, Cupid Media
    * only Gawker and Evernote were hashed and salted

* ideally, users choose passwords randomly

    * in practice, users choose common words (password, monkey, princess), proper nounds (julie, snoopy), and
      predictible sequences (abcdefg, asdfgh, 123456)

---

# Password Strength

* metrics such as entropy are misleading
    * $L*log_2(C)$, L = length, C = size of alphabet
    * P@sswOrd is far more common than gunpyo, but has higher entropy

* *guessing resistance*: estimate of how many guesses needed to crack password

---

# Online and Offline Guessing

* attacks on client don't involve guessing: malware, phishing, sniffing
* attacks on server's public facing web site: online guessing
* attacks on server's back end web site: offline guessing
    * gain access to system
    * be undetected (sysadmin can otherwise force system-wide password resets)
    * test passwords against hashes and salts

---
# Offline Attacks

# How Many Guesses?

<div style="float:left;width:35%;">

<ul>
<li>determines how difficult a password must be to guess</li>
<li>attackers can't make as many online guesses: need to be indistinguishable from ordinary traffic</li>
</ul>

</div>

---

# Policies

* composition and length
    * e.g. at least 8 characters, some uppercase and numbers
    * users respond with minimally compliant choices
    * overall, policies help to protect against online attacks, but not offline ones
    * users dislike them strongly
    * authors feel there are better alternatives

---

# Policies

* blacklists: common passwords or leaked passwords
    * protects users most at risk
    * can ban most popular passwords used at your site

* expiration
    * only helpful for offline attacks
    * users choose highly predictable variants

* rate-limiting and lockout
    * lockout can be abused for denial of service attack
    * rate-limiting effective against online attacks
    * can require CAPTCHA for new IPs

---

# Policies

* password meters
    * many JavaScript libraries are flawed and useless
    * need a stringent meter to have significant effect
    * do change user behavior for important accounts

* backup questions and reset
    * evidence shows that in practice the guessing space of
   security questions is far too small or can be looked up online
    * generally regarded a bad idea until more research done

# Advice: Do

* store passwords with salt and iterated hashing: slows offline guessing
* in case of break-in, detect leak and reset all user passwords
* use rate limiting and lockout: reduces online guessing
* use blacklisting: eliminates most-probable passwords
* use length rules: use $\geq 8$

---

# Advice: Don't

* use password meters: marginal gain
* use password aging: more harm than good
* use character-set rules: often bad return on user effort

---

# Conclusions

* we don't know how to help users resist offline password attacks -- all attempts so far are failures
* failed attempts waste a lot of user effort
* the task gets harder every year
* zero-user-burden mechanisms that largely or entirely eliminate online attacks are rarely used
