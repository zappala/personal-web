Today I am participating in a panel on *Using new technology to make a
difference* at the BYU Student Civic Engagement Workshop. This is an
event sponsored by the Civic Engagement minor in the Political Science
Department at BYU. I was introduced to this group by Rachel Stone, a
student at BYU who is very interested in civic technology, and invited
by Richard Harris, a faculty member in Political Science who is part
of the Civic Engagement program.

I have prepared a few slides to introduce myself to the audience and
to set the table for some discussion of how technology increases
engagement and transparency in city government.  My goal in giving
this talk is to get BYU students excited about civic hacking and to
encourage them to learn a bit about programming so they can be more
effective.
