Research
========

I am broadly interested in making the Internet work better. Currently,
my interests span the areas of networking, security, and usability,
with a focus on authentication and usable encryption. Past projects
have included multicast routing and transport protocols, streaming
video, peer-to-peer networking, and social networking.

Current Projects
----------------

`TrustBase <http://internet.byu.edu/research/trustbase>`__: TrustBase
is an architecture that provides certificate-based authentication as
an operating system service.  TrustBase enforces best practices for
certificate validation for all applications and transparently enables
existing applications to be strengthened against failures of the CA
system.

`TLS Proxies <http://internet.byu.edu/research/tls-proxies>`__: We
have been measuring the prevalence of TLS proxies using a tool we
deployed with a Google AdWords campaign.  We have also conducted
surveys to understand user attitudes and preferences toward the
inspection of encrypted traffic.

`Cloud Storage <http://internet.byu.edu/research/cloud-storage>`__: We
have been studying user perceptions and behavior with respect to cloud
storage services. In particular, we are interested in behaviors such
as which services are used, what types of data are stored, and how
collaboration and sharing are performed. We are also investigating
user attitudes toward cloud storage on topics such as payment, pri-
vacy, security, and robustness.

`Steam Measurements
<http://internet.byu.edu/research/steam-measurements>`__: We have
conducted a comprehensive measurement study of the Steam gaming
network, one of the largest gaming networks in the world. Unlike
previous studies that have relied on sampling techniques, our study is
the first complete examination of a major gaming network, measuring
all 108.7 million user accounts and 384.3 million owned games. We
examine gamer behavior across the dimensions of social connectivity,
playtime, game ownership, genre affinity, and monetary expenditure.
