Research
========

I am broadly interested in making the Internet work better. This
includes improving the infrastructure of the Internet (routing and
transport protocols), enhancing applications (streaming video,
peer-to-peer networking), and better understanding how we use the
Internet (measurement, social networking).

Current Projects
----------------

`Web Security <http://internet.byu.edu/research/web-security>`__: Measuring
the prevalence of TLS proxies and designing tools to detect them and notify
users. We will be designing new web authentication methods to provide
improved trust on the Internet.

`Personal Cloud Computing
<http://internet.byu.edu/research/personal-cloud>`__: Designing a
personal cloud system that transparently organizes all of the files on
your mobile and home computing devices.

`Sentiment Analysis
<http://internet.byu.edu/research/sentiment-analysis>`__: Exploring
how to automatically classify the political sentiment of tweets, so
that we can better quantify political feelings of people around the
world and track their changes over time.
