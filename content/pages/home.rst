Research
=====================

I direct the `Internet Research Lab <http://internet.byu.edu>`__,
where we conduct research on networking, security, and usability. Much
of our research is done jointly with the `Internet Security Research
Lab <http://isrl.byu.edu>`__, led by Kent Seamons. We are often
looking for good undergraduate and graduate students interested in
solving challenging problems in this area; please feel free to contact
me if you are interested, using my email address on the left. See my
`research page <|filename|research.rst>`__ for more details.

Teaching
=====================

For many years I have taught courses in Computer Networking and
Internet Programming. Recently I have begun teaching Web Programming
and will start teaching courses in Security.  See my `teaching page
<|filename|teaching.rst>`__ for more details.


Open Source Software and Research Artifacts
===========================================

I am a regular user and writer of open source software. I run Linux
natively on all my systems and have spent a number of years mentoring
students in independent open source projects. I believe creating open
source software -- both in my research and in service to the community
-- is at the heart of `BYU's mission
<http://aims.byu.edu/p/missionstatement>`__.

I am a strong believer that all scientists should publish their
research artifacts with every publication. This includes releasing
source code, documentation, data, scripts, user-study guides, survey
text, and so forth. We are increasing our efforts to provide all
materials needed to replicate our research whenever we publish a
paper.


Professional and Community Service
==================================

I currently serve as the Publicity Coordinator for ACSAC.  In the past
I have served on the Technical Program Commitee for NOSSDAV, IFIP
Networking, and IEEE Infocom for a number of years. I have also
chaired the Family History Technology Workshop.

I served on the planning commission and city council of `Cedar Hills
<http://cedarhills.org>`__ for a combined seven years. I also spent several
years on the board of the Lone Peak Public Safety District and
Utah Valley Dispatch. If you are at all interested in serving
politically, I would be happy to talk to you about it.

Reforming Software Patents
==========================

Software patents are threatening innovation, particularly for small
businesses and entrepreneurs. See this `EFF page
<https://www.eff.org/patent>`__ for a good overview of the
issues. Listen to When Patents Attack! `Part One
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack>`__
and `Part Two
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two>`__
by `This American Life <http://www.thisamericanlife.org/>`__ and
`Planet Money <http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/>`__.
