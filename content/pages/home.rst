Teaching and Research
=====================

I direct the `Internet Research Lab <http://internet.byu.edu>`__,
where we conduct research on networking, security, and usability. Much
of our research is done jointly with the `Internet Security Research
Lab <http://isrl.byu.edu>`__, led by Kent Seamons. We are often
looking for good undergraduate and graduate students interested in
solving challenging problems in this area; please feel free to contact
one of us if you are interested. See my `research page
<|filename|research.rst>`__ for more details.

I currently teach courses in Web Programming and Computer Networking,
and previously taught Internet Programming for many years. See my
`teaching page <|filename|teaching.rst>`__ for more details.


Open Source Software
====================

I am a regular user and writer of open source software. I run Linux
natively on all my systems and have spent a number of years mentoring
students in the `BYU Open Source Lab <http://osl.byu.edu>`__. I
believe creating open source software -- both in my research and in
service to the community -- is at the heart of `BYU's mission
<http://aims.byu.edu/p/missionstatement>`__.

One of the applications we built is called `Citizen Budget
<http://citizenbudget.org>`__, which helps provide budget transparency
for cities. It is currently in use by my city, Cedar Hills.  Another
application we run is called `leaf <http://leaf.byu.edu>`__, which
downloads your genealogy from `FamilySearch
<http://familysearch.org>`__ and show you were additional work needs
to be done.

Community Service
=================

I serve on the city council of `Cedar Hills
<http://cedarhills.org>`__, where my responsibilities having included finances,
technology, and open government. I also sit on the board for the Lone Peak Public Safety District,
which includes the `Lone Peak Police <http://www.lonepeakpolice.com/>`__ and `Lone Peak Fire <http://lonepeakfire.com/>`__ Departments.

Reforming Software Patents
==========================

Software patents are threatening innovation, particularly for small
businesses and entrepreneurs. See this `EFF page
<https://www.eff.org/patent>`__ for a good overview of the
issues. Listen to When Patents Attack! `Part One
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack>`__
and `Part Two
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two>`__
by `This American Life <http://www.thisamericanlife.org/>`__ and
`Planet Money <http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/>`__.
