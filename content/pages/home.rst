Teaching and Research
=====================

I teach courses in Internet Programming and Computer Networking.  I
also direct the `Internet Research Lab <http://internet.byu.edu>`__,
where we conduct research on Internet applications and infrastructure.
Our current projects involve Internet measurements, security, personal
cloud computing, and social networking. I am looking for good
undergraduate and graduate students interested in solving challenging
problems in this area.  See my `teaching page
<|filename|teaching.rst>`__ and my `research page
<|filename|research.rst>`__ for more details.


Open Source Software
====================

I direct the `BYU Open Source Lab <http://osl.byu.edu>`__, where we
mentor students through the process of creating open source software
in the spirit of community service that is at the heart of `BYU's
mission <http://aims.byu.edu/p/missionstatement>`__. 

One focus of the Open Source Lab is building apps for open government.
Groups like the `Sunlight Foundation
<http://sunlightfoundation.com/>`__, `Code for America
<http://sunlightfoundation.com/>`__, and numerous others are working
to open government data and apply technology to engage citizens. We
have our first app in this area, called `Citizen Budget
<http://citizenbudget.org>`__, and are working to develop others
that encourage civic engagement.

Another focus of the lab is family history software. While current
software is great at helping researchers record the conclusions of
their research, a lot of work is needed to provide collaborative tools
and software that helps people find who they should work on to keep
track of their research progress. Our first app in this area is called
`leaf <http://leaf.byu.edu>`__; it downloads your `FamilySearch
<http://familysearch.org>`__ data and show you were additional work
needs to be done.

Community Service
=================

I serve on the city council of `Cedar Hills
<http://cedarhills.org>`__, where my responsibilities include finances
and open government. I also sit on the board for `Utah Valley Dispatch
<http://www.utahvalley911.org/>`__ and the Lone Peak Public Safety District,
which includes the `Lone Peak Police <http://www.lonepeakpolice.com/>`__ and `Lone Peak Fire <http://lonepeakfire.com/>`__ Departments.

Reforming Software Patents
==========================

Software patents are threatening innovation, particularly for small
businesses and entrepreneurs. See this `EFF page
<https://www.eff.org/patent>`__ for a good overview of the
issues. Listen to When Patents Attack! `Part One
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack>`__
and `Part Two
<http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two>`__
by `This American Life <http://www.thisamericanlife.org/>`__ and
`Planet Money <http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/>`__.
